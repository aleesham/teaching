# Chapter 4: Relations and Functions

## Section 5: Cantor's Notion of Cardinality.
One of the most profound and uncomfortable ideas in modern mathematics is the ideas of inifinites. AS I talked about before, the interval (0,1) is the same size as the interval (0,2). In fact, they are both the same size as all of \RR. But they are bigger than the naturals, integers, and rationals. 

__Defn:__ Let A and B be sets. We say that A and B ahave the same cardinality if there is a bijective function from A to B. We write card(A)=card(B).

__Example:__

__Defn:__ Let A and B be sets. If there is a one-to-one function from A to B, but no bijection between A and B, then we will write
card(A) < card(B).

__Example:__ 

__Theorem:__ (Schroder-Bernstein)

__Proof:__ Omitted, but in the book. 

__Defn:__ countable, uncountable

__Examples:__
- 4.5.7
- 8
- 9
- 10?

__Defn:__ finite, infinite

__Prop:__ 4.5.13

__Proof:__

__Defn:__ countable

__Theorem:__ 4.5.14

__Proof:__

__Prop:__ 4.5.15

__Proof:__

__Corollary:__ 4.5.16

__Proof:__ Read this proof. 

__Corollary:__ 4.5.17

__Proof:__ 

__Prop:__ 4.5.24

__Proof:__

__Note:__ countable, uncountable. Something in between?

__Theorem:__ Cantor's Theorem.

__Proof:__

__Prop:__ Let S be a set. The set S is infinite if and only if it can be put in a one-to-one correspondence with a proper subset of itself. 

__Proof:__ Outlined in the exercise 4.41. Try this.

# Chapter 3: Set Theory (Review of Sections 1 through 4)

__Prop:__ Recall that two sets are equal if the contain precisely the same elements.

__Defn:__ S\subset T iff "x\in S implies x\in T" is true

__Prop:__ S=T iff S\subset T and T\subset S.

__Defn:__ empty set is the set with no elements.

__Defn:__ intersection x\in S\cap T iff x\in S \wedge x\in T

__Defn:__ union x\in S\cup T iff x\in S \vee x\in T

__Defn:__ S\times T ={(s,t): s\in S and t\in T}

__Defn:__ \script{P}(S) is the set of all subsets of S.
