Any questions?

# Chapter 3: Set Theory

### Section 3.1: Undefinable Terms

__Note:__ I suggest you read this. It talks about how we have to stop defining things at some point. For example, saying "the shortest path between two points." What is a path? What is a point? What do we mean by shortest path? 

So, basically, there are certain terms we consider undefinable. 

In modern mathematics, it is customary to use "set" and an "element of" a as undefinables. A set is declared to be a collection of objects. 

__Notation:__ 
- If S is a set and x is an element of S, we write x\in S or S \ni x.

__Definition:__ We say that two sets S and T are precisely equal when they have the same elements. We write S = T. 

__Example:__ {x in N such that x^2>3} = {x in N: x>2}


### Section 3.2: Elements of Set Theory

__Defintion:__ Let S and T be sets. We say that S is a subset of T and we write S \subset T or T \containing S if x\inS implies x\in T

__Example:__ 
- Page 59. Is S a subset of T or is T a subset of S? S of T, but not T of S.
- S = {x in N : x>3} and T = {x in N: x^2 > 4}
- S of T: Proof
- T of S: Counterexample.

__Example:__ 
- Page 59. Is S a subset of T or is T a subset of S? S of T, but not T of S.
- S = {-2, 3} and T = {x in Z : x^3-x^2-6x = 0}
- S of T: Proof
- T of S: Counterexample.

__Exercise:__ Let S = {x\in N x>=4} and T={x\in N: x<9}. Prve/disprove containments.

__Proposition:__ Let T and S be sets. Then S=T if and only if S subset T and T subset S. 

__Proof:__ Read pages 59-60.

__Definition:__ We let \emptyset denote the set that contains no elements. That is, for every x, x\not\in\emptyset. We call it the empty set. Another notation:{}. 

__Example:__ S = {x in R such that x^2 < 0}

__Note:__ If S is any set, then \emptyset\subset S.
