# Chapter Two: Methods of Proof

## Section 1: What is a proof?

Read this section. It tells you how mathematics is different than any other science.

The difference between mathematicians and other scientists is the fact that we will only take something as fact if it is one-hundred percent true. We construct proofs. As it turns out, we have discovered that there exist statements that can neither be proved true or false. This is a manifestation of G\"odel's incompleteness theorem: that any sufficiently complex logical system will contain such statements. However, for this class and much of undergraduate mathematics, we concentrate on statements which are provable or disprovable. 

Here, we will learn of different methods of proof. 

## Section 2: Direct proof

Here, we assume we know that the natural numbers \N = \{0,1,2,3,...\}. 
In this book, we define even and odd natural numbers as follows:

__Defintion:__ A natural number is said to be even if, when it is divided by two, there is no remainder. 
__Defintion:__ A natural number is said to be eveoddn if, when it is divided by two, the remainder is one.

Thus, by defintion (and the Euclidean algorithm), every natural number is either even or odd.

__Note:__ if a natural number n is even, we can write n=2k for some natural number k. Similarly if a natural number n is odd, we can write n=2k+1 for some natural number k.  

__Some terminology:__ Formal mathematical statements are refered to as theorems, propositions, and lemmas. Theorems are significant results, propositions of lesser importance, and lemmas are normally just needed to prove something larger.

Let us write our first direct proof:

__Propostion:__ The square of an even number is even. (Rewrite as an if-then.)

Proof on page 31

Why can't we use a truth table here? How can we use one? The truth table for A->B shows that if A is true, B must also be true, which is what we showed in our proof. 

__Proposition:__ The square of an odd number is odd. 

__Proposition:__ Prove that if n is a positive integer, then the quantity n^2+3n+2 is even. 


__Proposition:__ The sum of two odd natural numbers is even (Exercise)

__Proposition:__ The sum of an even natural number and an odd natural number is odd.

__Proposition:__ The sum of two even numbers is even. (Exercise)

__Proposition:__ Let n be a natural number. Then either n>6 or n<9.
 
Rewrite an if-then. Show that we assumed that if n is not greater than 6 it must be less than 9. 

__Example:__ Prove that every even integer can be written as the sum of two odd integers. 

__Example:__ Prove the Pythagorean theorem.

## Section 3: Proof by Contradiction

Rational numbers: what are they?

Again, in mathematics a statement is either true or it is false. If we can prove that A could not possibly be false, then it must be true. Similarly, if we can prove that A could not be true, then it must be false. We will explore a very popular example:

__Theorem:__ There is no rational number with the property that x^2 = 2.
