- Quickly go over the syllabus.
- Mention Exam Days and Holidays.
- Mention that this class might feel unorganized.
- Read Chapter 1 in Krantz

## Introduction with Geometry
- Do you remember high school geometry? Let us quickly do a T-chart proof and write it into a paragraph.

Assume that FH is the perpendicular bisector of EG. By definition of perpendicular bisector, the angles EHF and GHF are congruent and right. Furthermore, the segments EH and GH are of the same length, again because FH is the perpendicular bisector of EG. Because FH is of course equal to itself, we can conclude that EHF and GHF are congruent by the side-angle-side congruency law. Hence, EF and FG are of the same length because congruent parts of congruent triangles are congruent. Finally, by the definition of isoceles triangle, our triangle EFG is isoceles.

## Introduction with Logic Puzzles
- Now, let us do some logic puzzles.  
    - 1. [The Liar and the Truth Teller:](https://brilliant.org/wiki/truth-tellers-and-liars/)
    - 2. [The Tweleve Pills Problem:](http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/55618.html) 
    - 3. There are three boxes in front of you. One box has only apples, one has only oranges, and the last has both apples and oranges. The first box has the label "apples," the second "oranges," and the third "apples and oranges." Unfortunately, all of the boxes are labeled wrong, and you are tasked with fixing them. You aren't allowed to peek inside any of the boxes, but you are able to ask for a single sample from any box. That is, someone will show you just one item from one box of your choosing. Which box can you choose from that will guarantee enough information to fix the labels?

## Section 1.0: A Remark from Aleesha.  
Note that I will be referencing both texts for the majority of Chapter One (in Krantz). Having Krantz's book will be sufficient, but I find some of the wording in Campbell's book to be a bit easier. 

## Section 1.1: Principles of Logic
__Defintion:__
## Section 1.2: Truth
## Section 1.3: "And" and "Or"
## Section 1.4: "Not"
## Section 1.5: "If - Then"
